Hey everyone! I'm Peyton Walters and I'm a student at the University of Pennsylvania studying [Networked and Social Systems Engineering](https://www.nets.upenn.edu/).

I'm particularly interested in IP networking, distributed systems, and Unix-based operating systems, but there are far more things than that which pique my interest. Some of my past and current work includes:

- [Caplance](https://github.com/Pwpon500/caplance), a network-level load balancer in the spirit of Maglev
- [Jiffy](https://github.com/Pwpon500/Jiffy), a program that automated the deployment of KVM/Libvirt virtual machines
- An ansible and ruby program to automate the deployment of ssh keys
- [Go Log Server](https://github.com/Pwpon500/go-log-server), simple program to send rsyslog entries to a redis stream
- [Alpine](https://github.com/Pwpon500/alpine), a chef cookbook to add chef support to Alpine Linux
