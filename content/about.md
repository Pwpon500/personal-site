Hey everyone! I'm Peyton Walters and I'm a student at the University of Pennsylvania studying [Networked and Social Systems Engineering](https://www.nets.upenn.edu/) and a software engineering contractor for [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/).

I'm particularly interested in distributed systems (particularly Kubernetes), IP networking, and Unix-based operating systems, but there are far more things than that which pique my interest. Some of my past and current work includes:

- [SPIRE TPM Plugin](https://github.com/bloomberg/spire-tpm-plugin), a set of plugins to allow [SPIRE](https://github.com/spiffe/spire) to do TPM 2-based node attestation
- [Penn Labs' Infrastructure](https://github.com/pennlabs/infrastructure/), a repository to fully control a [Penn Labs'](https://pennlabs.org/) infrastructure as code
- [Caplance](https://github.com/Pwpon500/caplance), a network-level load balancer in the spirit of Maglev
- [Jiffy](https://github.com/Pwpon500/Jiffy), a program that automated the deployment of KVM/Libvirt virtual machines
- [Go Log Server](https://github.com/Pwpon500/go-log-server), simple program to send rsyslog entries to a redis stream
- [Alpine](https://github.com/Pwpon500/alpine), a chef cookbook to add chef support to Alpine Linux
