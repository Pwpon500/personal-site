> Like the water, the Walden ice, seen near at hand, has a green tint, but at a distance is beautifully blue, and you can easily tell it from the white ice of the river, or the merely greenish ice of some ponds, a quarter of a mile off. Sometimes one of those great cakes slips from the ice-man's sled into the village street, and lies there for a week like a great emerald, an object of interest to all passers.

This excerpt from Thoreau's novel *Walden* is a description of simple pond ice yet manages to be some of most stunning imagery I've ever come across.

Peterson's concept of "found time" is wack:

> That's the time when you're driving or the time when you're doing dishes. Now all of a sudden you can educate yourself during that found time.
