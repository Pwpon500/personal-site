This recipe was inspired by J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt's [video on oyakodon](https://youtu.be/NcXzpCqKdUA). While this is inspired by Oyakodon, it is in no way trying to be Oyakodon, particularly because of the lack of dashi. I will probably try to make Oyakodon at some point, but you're definitely better off just watching Kenji's video for info on that :)

{{< ingredients Omelette >}}

- 1/2 yellow onion
- Sesame oil
- Salt
- Pepper
- Olive oil

1. Whisk eggs, a dash of soy sauce, and a drop of sesame oil until homogenous
2. Dice onion, slice mushrooms, slice chicken thigh
3. Add onion, chicken thigh, and mushrooms to an 8-inch nonstick pan with olive oil. Cook on medium heat until onions have browned and the chicken has cooked through.
4. Switch stove to low heat
5. Add egg mixture to pan and immediately cover. Cook until the sides of the egg have fully cooked through.
6. Carefully fold omelette over and cut heat
7. Let sit for 1 min so the omelette has a chance to bind together
8. Serve! I like serving this with Sriracha; the heat and acidity cuts the depth of the sesame oil very nicely.

If you haven't checked out Kenji's channel, definitely give it a shot! He's inspired a lot of my favorite everyday recipes.
