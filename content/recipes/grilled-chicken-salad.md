### Dressing

1. Dice peppers, removing seeds if you want a low-heat sauce
2. Combine vinaigrette, honey, and peppers
3. Thoroughly mix until honey/balsamic mixture is homogenous
4. Let sit while you prepare the salad
    - This will let the peppers absorb into the dressing, enhancing the heat and flavor of the dressing

### Salad

1. Cut romaine into inch-long chunks along the width of the leaf
2. Dice onion, bell pepper
3. Wash and slice mushrooms
4. Peel and slice carrots. I just use the peeler to slice as it gives me consistent, firm slices
6. Slice chicken into long strips
5. Reheat grilled chicken
    - I actually recommend using the microwave for this as reheating in a pan will leave you with a lot of lost moisture.
7. Combine all ingredients with lettuce at the bottom, veggies in the middle, and chicken on top
8. Dress and serve!

This salad is quick, delicious, and healthy! I'd highly recommend trying it out, especially if you have leftover grilled chicken. If you don't, I'd recommend just going with a simple oven-baked chicken recipe. It's possible to do in a pan, but you have to either nail the timing or use a lot of butter if you don't want the chicken to go dry.
