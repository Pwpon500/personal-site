1. Cut potatoes into quarter-inch thick coins
2. Slice garlic thinly
3. Cover bottom of large pan with olive oil
4. Add garlic and cook over medium-high heat until garlic is simmering
5. Add potatoes; stir until all are covered with olive oil
6. Add herb mix, salt, and pepper to taste
7. Cook until potatoes are easily pierced with fork, but not soft. This will take 10-20 minutes depending on personal preference.

Once the potatoes have reached your desired firmness, remove from oil and serve!
