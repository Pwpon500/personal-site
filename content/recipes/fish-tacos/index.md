1. Dice red onion and bell peppers
2. Slice jalapeño along the width of the pepper (resulting should be rings of pepper)
3. Slice fish into 1in x 0.5in x 0.25in chunks
4. In a small pan, heat olive oil on high heat
5. Add fish to pan, stirring constantly
6. Season fish with salt and pepper to taste
7. Heat tortilla over burner until floppy. This will help the gluten loosen up so the tortilla doesn't crack and fall apart.
8. Start building! Add in order:
    1. Fish
    2. Red onion
    3. Bell pepper
    4. Jalapeño
    5. Salsa

Fold up your tortilla and eat!

If you feel the taco is missing a little bit of crunch, feel free to add some julienned cabbage. I choose not to because I think it overcrowds the taco, but if your tortilla is big enough, cabbage can be a great addition for some extra crunch.
