## Preparation

Before starting, preheat your oven to 400Â°F!

First, we prepare our sauce:

1. Mince or pulverize garlic
2. Dice shallot
3. Finely chop parsley
4. Zest and juice lemon
5. Combine butter, parsley, shallot, garlic, lemon juice, and lemon zest into small saucepan
6. Heat on low heat until everything is melted and mixed. Do not simmer!
7. Season with salt and pepper to taste

Once our sauce is ready, we'll cook our mahi:

1. Dry mahi with paper towel. This will give us a better sear.
2. Liberally season both sides with salt and pepper
3. Heat a pan (metal handle) with olive oil until smoking
4. Drop mahi and sear on one side
5. Once seared on the first side, flip and cook in oven for 5 minutes

Once the mahi is done, plate with a spoonful of sauce on top, and you're good to go!
